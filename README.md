# Fintech 

Original design: [Fintech Dark Theme](https://dribbble.com/shots/15668611-Fintech-Dark-Theme)
 
The main goal of this view, and this front, was managing the "view inside of a view" for achieving this I took some design choices, mainly cuz I did want to bloat the project with images, even the icons and some images arent the same, you get the idea and flow of the view.

## Icons 

For the icons I went straight forward for the easiest, SF Symbols, nothing fancy.

## Fonts

Same here, I used the native SF font, for everything trying to match the sizes and weights.

## Animation

Since it seems isn't a custom animation, I rather prefer to go for a nice "spring" animation instead of trying to guess the animation curve (a EaseInOut seems to be the proper one but didnt work so fine)

## Loading

Making the custom loading wasn't part of the challenge (my challente my rules) I could have done it but have extended the time of the project, maybe in a near future will added, isn't anything from another universe its just adding a custom animation(png sequence, üëé, or using a lottie animation, üëç)

## Slides (dots)

I really didn't want to do this mostly cuz the "interactive" or "touch points" are already way to complex, more than a "coding" issues I'll have to manage some UX issues that are only solved by changing the design.
